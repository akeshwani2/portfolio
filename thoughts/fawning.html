            <p>i learned early how to really listen — not just hear people, but track every shift, every tone, every feeling. i could say the right thing, ask the right question. people walked away feeling understood, and i walked away feeling a bit… not there. it didn’t feel strange. it just felt like my role.</p>

            <p>when your parents can’t handle their own emotions, love becomes something you earn by being useful. calm. steady. so you keep the peace. you read the room, soften your reactions, fix the vibe. and while you’re doing that, parts of you start fading without you noticing.</p>

            <p>it’s called emotional parentification — the kid ends up managing the parent’s emotional world. and it doesn’t just affect your childhood; it shapes how you operate as a person.</p>

            <p>people who grow up like this often develop alexithymia — struggling to identify or express their own feelings. you’re so tuned into everyone else that your own emotions blur. overloaded and numb, like feeling everything and nothing at the same time.</p>

            <p>when you grow up around big emotions but little safety, your nervous system adapts. you watch people’s moods like weather: tone shifts, how someone sits down, how fast they reply, a weird pause — all of it becomes information. survival information.</p>

            <p>that’s the “fawn” response. not fight, flight, or freeze — but appease. instead of reacting, you adjust. you make yourself easy to handle so you don’t get hurt or abandoned.</p>

            <p>from the outside, it doesn’t look like trauma. it looks like empathy. kindness. “emotional intelligence.” people love that you’re chill and understanding. they don’t see you editing yourself in real time. they don’t see the cost.</p>

            <p>the pain shows up quietly: staying silent when something bothered you, saying yes when you want no, the automatic “whatever works for you.” the way you shrink without thinking about it.</p>

            <p>the more you do it, the easier it is to lose yourself. what do you want? what do you like? where do you end and they begin? over time, you become the flexible one, the stable one, the one who adjusts. that role keeps the peace, but it costs honesty.</p>

            <p>eventually it becomes a mask you forget how to take off.</p>

            <p>social rejection lights up similar parts of the brain as physical pain. so if being “too much” ever felt risky, your brain steps in. it trims away whatever might cause conflict. it teaches you to fit. to make yourself small enough to be safe.</p>

            <p>you start confusing fitting in with belonging.</p>

            <p>after a while, it feels like people love you because you don’t have needs. because you’re “low maintenance.” and under that is a quiet exhaustion — the fast “it’s fine,” the things you swallow.</p>

            <p>being easy to love starts feeling heavy.</p>

            <p>because every time you bend to keep the peace, you teach yourself your needs are extra. that the full version of you is dangerous. and the question creeps in: if i stopped doing this… would they still want me?</p>

            <p>people with anxious or disorganized attachment often end up hyper-focused on others’ emotions. constantly managing fears that aren’t theirs. it turns into chronic fawning. apologizing for taking up space. feeling guilty for boundaries.</p>

            <p>you learn that love = keeping everyone else okay. even when you’re not.</p>

            <p>it’s not that people’s love is fake. it’s just built on the parts of you you feel safe showing. so your relationships reflect your performance, not your whole self. people care about you, but you don’t feel fully seen. you can be close to people and still feel far away.</p>

            <p>being easy to love can make you hard to actually know.</p>

            <p>some people react by going cold and distant. shutting down. acting like nothing touches them. it feels like armor — if no one gets close, no one can ask anything of you. but that’s just another way of disappearing.</p>

            <p>the real work is quieter: being honest. not brutally honest — just honest enough that you stop abandoning yourself. letting silence sit instead of rushing to smooth it over. saying “i don’t know how i feel yet.” admitting when something hurts. saying “that doesn’t work for me” and not immediately taking it back.</p>

            <p>letting yourself have needs. even small ones.</p>

            <p>making space for love that doesn’t require you to shrink.</p>

            <p>you’re not an emotional support system disguised as a person. you’re a person. with your own wants and fears and confusing feelings.</p>

            <p>if you’re tired, it makes sense. masks are heavy. always being “easy” is heavy. you weren’t meant to live as a reflection of what other people need.</p>

            <p>love isn’t supposed to be constant shapeshifting.</p>

            <p>and being easy to love shouldn’t be the price of being loved at all.</p>
